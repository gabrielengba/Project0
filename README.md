# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This blog shows a brief academic history of mine at Universidade Salvador (UNIFACS). It is divided into 4 pages (Home, About, Projects and Contact). I used the tools learned in the course until lecture1!

1.Index.html(Home)

 This file was the basis of the project. I used bootstrap, selectors( "+" , ">" , "::" , ":" and ","), ".class", "#id" , ".css" and ".scss"

2.About.html

3.Projects.html

 I used Ordered List.
 
4.Contact

 I used forms.
